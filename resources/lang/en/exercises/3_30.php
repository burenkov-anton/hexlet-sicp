        "The inputs A₁, A₂, A₃, ..., Aₙ and B₁, B₂, B₃, ..., Bₙ are the two binary numbers to be added (each Aₖ and Bₖ is a 0 or a 1). " .
        "The circuit generates S₁, S₂, S₃, ..., Sₙ, the n bits of the sum, and C, the carry from the addition. " .

        "The procedure should take as arguments three lists of n wires each -- the Aₖ, the Bₖ, and the Sₖ -- and also another wire C. " .
